Decentralized p2p behind NAT.

## Security warning

This project's code and some of the cryptographic libraries it uses have not been formally audited and therefore there is no way to guarantee that it's free of security issues. Before use, consider this information in your risk analysis.

## Description

The goal of this project is to establish peer-to-peer connections between devices that are behind NAT in the simplest way possible without the need to use a service that has a login or manage a public facing server.
